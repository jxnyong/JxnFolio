# JxnFolio - Personal Website
<p>A personal portfolio website built to showcase my journey, projects, and skills along the way. Started off simple using basic frameworks such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript but slowly transitioned and integrated ReactJS, and Tailwind. Improvements and changes are to be expected as my journey of learning and exploration continues. </p>

As of now, it is still purely a bareback frontend website.
